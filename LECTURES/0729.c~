What is atomic operation?

example of atomic operation?

why is it important that some operations are atomic?

atomic = once start, it can not be divided



a = 5;
a++

read a
increment
write a

Two or use threads share data, data change is not atomic -> problems


a = 4
  t1 a++;
t2 a++;

synchronization:

t1 modifying shared data (read/write)
t2 should be no change/read shared data



  a = 4;

t1 = a++;
t2 =  x = a;
      y = a;

Which one is it gonna read? 4 or 5?

mutually exclusive (atomic)
